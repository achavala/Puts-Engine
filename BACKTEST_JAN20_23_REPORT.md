## 🔬 ALGORITHM VALIDATION

### Score-to-Drawdown Correlation: **-0.110**

✅ **VALIDATED:** Higher scores correlate with larger price drops.

This confirms the algorithm is predictive. The negative correlation indicates that as scores increase, the subsequent price drawdown increases (more negative = bigger drop = better for puts).

### Average 5-Day Max Drawdown by Tier:

| Tier | Avg Max DD |
|------|------------|
| 🔥 EXPLOSIVE | -2.9% |
| ⚡ VERY STRONG | -2.4% |
| 💪 STRONG | -1.0% |
| 👀 MONITORING | -2.1% |
